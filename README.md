# Indian-Mobile-Circle-JSON
A json file containing 2625 mobile circles of India.

After hundreds of unsuccessful searches for a AngularJS to find the mobile circle which could work the way I wanted it to, I gave up. Then, I began searching for a .json from which I could directly fetch the information and make it work, there too, I failed, I couldn't find the "perfect" file.

So, I gathered the data from multiple sources based on latest data available till Dec 2016 and converted it to a JSON.

P.S. Mobile network details are subject to change as the Mobile number portability (MNP) is available in most of the circles.

Here is a small snippet :)

```json
[
  {
    "circle_id": "7020",
    "circle_name": "Maharashtra (includes Goa but excludes Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan)",
    "circle_operator": "Reliance Jio"
  },
  {
    "circle_id": "7021",
    "circle_name": "Mumbai Metro (includes Navi Mumbai and Kalyan)",
    "circle_operator": "Reliance Jio"
  }
]
